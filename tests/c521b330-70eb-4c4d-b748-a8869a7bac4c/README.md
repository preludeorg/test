# Will your computer quarantine a malicious file?

This test uses a popular payload-generating software known as Msfvenom to generate a malicious payload, which is then compiled into the VST. 
Msfvenom is widely used by threat actors to quickly embed malicious code into otherwise benign files. The embedded code could be anything: 
a reverse shell, a ransomware attack or in this case, just a simple "whoami" command to print the current user's name. 
Because this software is so popular, it carries a signature that can be flagged whenever a file generated by it is saved to the hard drive. 

For Linux and macOS a base64 encoded common reverse shell payload is used. A reverse shell provides an attacker with command-line access that they would not otherwise have. To keep this test secure, we have it pointing to localhost. A user must manually execute this payload for it to operate or execute it using one of our probes.

Defenses should quarantine files with known signatures immediately.

## How

> Safety: the file has been defanged, so even if run, it will only print your username or start a reverse shell pointing to localhost.

A file containing an operating specific payload is dropped to disk either by a probe or standalone. Using a probe the file is executed automatically and attempts to execute one of the operating system specific payloads if it is not quarantined.
